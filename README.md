# python-stock
A script that scrapes websites for information regarding stocks
so that the user can make analysis based on the data

Since beginner in Python I am going to use some help and from there form my own code 
so that it fits my needs.

For the stock information and how to write the script I will use:

- https://dataheadhunters.com/academy/how-to-create-a-stock-market-analysis-tool-in-python-for-finance

For webscraping and how it's done I will learn from:
